# 🌍 Melting Winters, Shifting Seasons: Tracking 50 Years of Climate Change in the UK  
### SAS Curiosity Cup 2025 – 

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how the UK climate has evolved over the past five decades and forecasts future changes up to 2050. By analyzing historical weather station data (1974–2024) using **SAS Viya, Python, and Excel**, we uncovered long-term trends in **temperature**, **frost days**, **rainfall**, and **sunshine hours**, while applying **SARIMA forecasting** to project these metrics into the future.

The project reveals significant shifts, such as **warmer winters**, **shorter frost seasons**, **earlier spring onset**, and **increased rainfall variability**—key indicators of climate transformation that affect agriculture, biodiversity, infrastructure, and daily life in the UK.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze 50 years of UK historical climate data from Met Office station records
- Conduct deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and climate trend analysis
- Engineer new climate features (e.g., growing season length, frost events)
- Apply **SARIMA** models to forecast climate variables up to 2050
- Present results with **interactive dashboards** and compelling visuals

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removed stations with missing/incomplete records and standardized sunshine sensor transitions (Campbell-Stokes vs Kipp & Zonen)
- **Feature Engineering:** Created features for average temperature, last spring frost, growing season, extreme rainfall, and seasonal indicators
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified warming trends in winters, shifting seasonal boundaries, and rising rainfall intensity
- **Forecasting:** Used **SARIMA** to project future values for max/min temperature, rainfall, sunshine, and frost days
- **Tools Used:** 
  - **SAS Viya for Learners** (Visual Analytics + Time Series Forecasting)
  - **Python** (Data Wrangling, EDA, Visualization)
  - **Excel** (Data exploration, preprocessing)

## 📈 Key Findings

- **UK winters have warmed** by ~1.5°C since the 1970s, with frost days declining steadily.
- **Spring is arriving ~11 days earlier** now than in 1974, with longer growing seasons (+22 days).
- **Extreme rainfall events have increased**, with more frequent “wet years” since 2000.
- **Forecasts predict** further warming trends, fewer frost days, and longer summers by 2050.
- **Sunshine hours are increasing**, potentially supporting agriculture—but also contributing to drought risks.
